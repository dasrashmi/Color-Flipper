# Color-Flipper
A background color flipper mini project made with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
Here are the highlights of tags and functions used in this project:

1.	Color flipper:

#<nav> tag -> The nav element defines a set of navigation links.
 
In this project we are using nav element for “Simple” and “hex”.

#<div> tag-> The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
So, here we have used two <div> class: “nav-center”( navigation link like “simple” and “hex” ) and “container”( background color )

#<span> tag -> The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

#<main> tag -> The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document. There must not be more than one <main> element in a document.

	DOM
#getElementById -> The getElementById() method is one of the most common methods in the HTML DOM. It is used almost every time you want to read or edit an HTML element. If two or more elements with the same id exist, getElementById() returns the first.
#querySelector -> The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches a CSS selector.
#addEventListener -> The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to a document.

#Math.random() -> The Math.random() method returns a random number from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1 (exclusive).

#Math.floor() -> The Math.floor() method rounds a number DOWN to the nearest integer.
